Description: Contains functions to easily analyse leaf length data in millimeter to 
    obtain leaf elongation rates (mm/h) and to analyse microscopy data (i.e. meristem 
    length and cell lengths, both in micrometer) to obtain a range of kinematic 
    paramters on cell division and elongation.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.6.1)
